# Cellular Senescence Notes

## Definition
Cellular senescence: irreversible cell cycle arrest in response to various stressors.

## Key Characteristics
- Permanent growth arrest
- Resistance to apoptosis
- SASP (Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype)
- Morphological changes
- Metabolic alterations

## Types of Senescence
1. **Replicative Senescence**
   - Telomere shortening (Hayflick limit)
   - ~50-60 divisions in human fibroblasts

2. **Stress-Induced Premature Senescence**
   - DNA damage
   - Oxidative stress
   - Oncogene activation

## SASP (Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype)
Senescent cells secrete:
- Pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8)
- Growth factors
- Proteases (MMPs)

### Effects:
- **Beneficial**: Wound healing, tumor suppression
- **Detrimental**: Chronic inflammation, tissue dysfunction

## Molecular Markers
- p16^INK4a upregulation
- p21 expression
- SA-β-gal activity
- γH2AX foci (DNA damage)

## Relevance to Aging
- Accumulation of senescent cells with age
- Contribute to age-related diseases
- Target for therapeutic intervention

## Current Research Directions
- Senolytics (drugs that eliminate senescent cells)
- Senomorphics (drugs that suppress SASP)
- Cellular reprogramming
