# Longevity Interventions - Learning Notes

## Dietary Interventions

### Caloric Restriction (CR)
- Reduces calorie intake without malnutrition
- Extends lifespan in multiple model organisms
- Mechanisms: SIRT1 activation, mTOR inhibition, autophagy

### Intermittent Fasting
- Time-restricted eating
- Activates similar pathways to CR
- More practical for humans

## Pharmacological Interventions

### Rapamycin
- mTOR inhibitor
- Extends lifespan in mice
- Challenges: Immunosuppression side effects

### Metformin
- AMPK activator
- Potential geroprotector
- Currently in human trials (TAME study)

### NAD+ Precursors
- NMN, NR supplementation
- Restore NAD+ levels (decline with age)
- Supports sirtuins, DNA repair

### Senolytics
- Dasatinib + Quercetin
- Eliminate senescent cells
- Early human trials ongoing

## Genetic Interventions

### CRISPR Applications
- Targeting aging genes (mTOR, IGF-1)
- Epigenetic reprogramming
- Telomerase reactivation

### Yamanaka Factors
- Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc (OSKM)
- Cellular reprogramming
- Partial reprogramming to reverse aging markers

## Emerging Technologies

### Cellular Reprogramming
- Induced pluripotency
- Transient OSKM expression
- Rejuvenation without dedifferentiation

### Senolytic Therapies
- Target and clear senescent cells
- Reduce chronic inflammation
- Improve tissue function

### Gene Therapy
- AAV-mediated delivery
- Follistatin (muscle regeneration)
- Klotho (neuroprotection)

## Model Organisms

### C. elegans
- Short lifespan (~3 weeks)
- Genetic tractability
- daf-2 mutations extend lifespan

### Drosophila
- Complex physiology
- ~60-80 days lifespan
- Rapamycin extends lifespan

### Mice
- Mammalian model
- ~2-3 years lifespan
- Most translatable to humans

### Naked Mole Rats
- Exceptional longevity (~30 years)
- Cancer resistance
- Study of natural longevity mechanisms

## Key Pathways

1. **mTOR Pathway**
   - Nutrient sensing
   - Growth regulation
   - Target for rapamycin

2. **Insulin/IGF-1 Signaling**
   - Metabolic regulation
   - Mutations extend lifespan in worms, flies

3. **Sirtuins**
   - NAD+-dependent deacetylases
   - Involved in stress response
   - Activated by CR, resveratrol

4. **AMPK**
   - Energy sensor
   - Activated by metformin
   - Promotes autophagy

## Current Limitations
- Translation from mice to humans unclear
- Long timescales for human studies
- Ethical considerations
- Individual variability

## Future Directions
- Combination therapies
- Personalized interventions
- Biomarkers of aging (epigenetic clocks)
- Systems biology approaches
