# Aging Research Notes

My personal learning notes on aging biology, cellular senescence, and longevity research.

## Contents
- Cellular Senescence
- Longevity Interventions
- CRISPR Applications in Aging Research

## Purpose
This repository serves as my knowledge base as I prepare for studies in Biotechnology with a focus on aging biology.

## Topics Covered
- Molecular mechanisms of cellular aging
- Senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)
- Senolytics and senomorphics
- Epigenetic clocks
- Hallmarks of aging

## Resources
Based on readings from scientific literature, online courses, and textbooks in molecular biology and gerontology.
